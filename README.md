# Black Money
### Short note on the theme:
This theme has multiple facets, which I wanted to express through the background images — one of them being the theme of money.
The idea was to create a certain vibe around money through different background motifs and interpretations — whether “gangster,” “mafia,” or general Illuminati-style symbolism. You can choose for yourself.

The color palette is inspired by the original U.S. dollar, with the red color taken from the Chinese renminbi.
