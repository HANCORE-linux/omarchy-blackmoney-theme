# Black Money
In darkness there’s value — deep blacks set the stage, while subtle green-gold highlights whisper of clandestine wealth and quiet precision.
This palette draws inspiration from sleek machinery, old-money mechanics, and the elegances of covert exchange.
Created for those who want a workspace that feels powerful, focused, and quietly opulent.

- Major color palette of US-Dollar currency and red-accent is chinese renminbi yuan color palette <br>
